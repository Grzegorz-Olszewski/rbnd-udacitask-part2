# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I chose terminal-table. I use it in all method in udacilist class. It makes table look nice.
2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) New class, and item GoalItem. You can add goal to list with level of importance. 
  b) I changed delete method to allow deletion of multiply items.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
4-5 hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
All those errors that I though through.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
New item type-goal, and I changed delete method to allow deletion of multiply items.
I think goal is completely different than to-do. Goal is built upon to-dos, so it's worth having own type.
Deletion of multiply items at once might be handy :).
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I think that I should make some strategy for finding solutions. When I have some error I try everything without
any order or reflection.
